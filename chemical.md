<h2> Chemical </h2>

<h3> SEA WATER</h3>
    
  <p>  The chemistry of the ocean is closely tied to ocean circulation, climate, the plants and animals that live in the ocean, and the exchange of material with the atmosphere, cryosphere, continents, and mantle.
    
    Salinity
        Salinity is the amount of dissolved solids in seawater
        
    Determining the density of seawater
        An electrical conductivity meter, or EC meter, is the only common device that can be used to measure the salinity of water.You can also use a refractometer or hydrometer.It is measured in PPT (parts per thousand) </p>

 <h3>BIOCHEMICAL </h3>
 <p>  People in this feild study both organic and inorganic compounds, particulate and dissolved material, and the ocean sediments.
    One important aspect of chemical oceanography is the study of pollutants. This work may lead chemical oceanographers to the deep ocean, coastal bays and estuaries, or inland rivers, streams and lakes.
    One example of this is carbon. Carbon is the building block of life on Earth. Plants in the ocean use photosynthesis to take in the carbon and make it food. Then animals consume the plants and take in the organic carbon into their own bodies. The food chain continues and eventually when the animals die carbon is recycled into the soil so that it becomes available to microbes and phytoplankton.</p>
